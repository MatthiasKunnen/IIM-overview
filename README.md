# IIM
Intelligent Inventory Manager

This is the IIM admin data panel created for HoGent. 
It's created to provide an overview for people that manage the inventory and unfortunately also to "just make something using Java Spring".

This is a copy of the private repo of which I couldn't copy the pull requests nor issues unfortunately. 
Any passwords and credentials that remain in the repository no longer work.
